Project ideas:

Idea 1:  Game using Google Map 

	- User solves a mystery using things collected on Google Maps 
		-we place on the markers on the map (probably design a few different markers for different types of items/clues/events) in predefined locations and the user navigates the map on the device - does not integrate physically walking places.  The map is essentially the gameboard.  We'd just pick a location for the mystery to occur and that's where it would be for all users
	- Things that happen when a user touches a marker can include simple clues, object collection, and maybe a few mini-games
		- Maybe one of these could need the camera or external device to fullfil #4 and 5
		- Another could use a web service
		- clues/objects could be stored using internal storage to fullfil another requirement.
	- This also allows for expansion if other GV students wanted to add more cases.

Idea 2:  GVSU Classroom/Office Map

	- Allows user to look up any classroom or faculty office on the Allendale campus and find it on Google Maps
	- I like this idea less because it would be a lot more non-coding work on our part - we'd have to figure out the coordinates of every classroom and office on campus, figure out which faculty occupy each office, and make our own database with that information.

If you guys have other ideas, I'm open to them.
