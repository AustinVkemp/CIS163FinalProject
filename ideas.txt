Project ideas:

Idea 1:  Game using Google Map 

	- User solves a mystery using things collected on Google Maps (we place on the markers on the map in predefined locations and the user navigates the map on the device - does not integrate walking places.  We'd just pick a location for the mystery to occur and that's where it would be for all users)
	- Things can include simple clues and maybe a few mini-games
		- Maybe one of these could need the camera or external device to fullfil #4 and 5
		- Another could use a web service
	- This also allows for expansion if other GV students wanted to add more cases.
