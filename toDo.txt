Things that need done for the final project:

	-store data after game completes - I believe we had a lab about something similar to this 
		-things could be updated (saved on system)
			- Free-For-All Wins +1 or 
			- Bounty Hunter Wins +1 and
			- Also loses for each
			- Lifetime Kills +totalKills
		- Mike

	-add at least 5 achievements (we should make these fairly easy to implement)
		- kill all the other players in an 8 player free-for-all (serial killer?)
		- win certain number of free-for-all matches
		- win certain number of bounty hunter matches
		- total kills excedes certain number
		- kill single player multiple times
		-Austin

	-add instructions activity accessable from main screen
		-Austin

	-add kills/stats screen accessable from main screen
		-use stored data talked about above
		-Mike

	-figure out what to do in the final screen (probably display 'you win' or something and button to take player back to first screen)
		-Mike


	-debug game logic
		-Katherine
		
	optional:
	- add leaderboard (google developer has API for that)
