Things that need done for the final project:

	-fix RestoreInstanceState and all the put stuff so that variables do not reset on orientation change
		-Mike lock in portrait

	-store data after game completes - I believe we had a lab about something similar to this 
		-things could be updated (saved on system)
			- Free-For-All Wins +1 or 
			- Bounty Hunter Wins +1 and
			- Also loses for each
			- Lifetime Kills +totalKills
		- Mike

	-add at least 5 achievements (we should make these fairly easy to implement)
		- kill all the other players in an 8 player free-for-all (serial killer?)
		- win certain number of free-for-all matches
		- win certain number of bounty hunter matches
		- total kills excedes certain number
		- kill single player multiple times
		-Austin


	-add instructions activity accessable from main screen
		-Austin

	-add kills/stats screen accessable from main screen
		-use stored data talked about above
		-Mike

	-change "stats" on map/kills screen to brief instuctions button (better name for this)
		-shows pop-up with instructions that Austin typed for main screen
		-Katherine

	-figure out what to do in the final screen (probably display 'you win' or something and button to take player back to first screen)
		-Mike

	-figure out why set URI in recyclerView is not working when picture is available
		(also remove player from list of people to kill...but later so that we can see multiple people on list while testing)
		-Katherine

	-debug game logic
		-Katherine
		
	optional:
	- add leaderboard (google developer has API for that)
