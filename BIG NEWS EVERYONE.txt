I was looking on the google play services page and it looks like we wont really need the
add info activity for a picture and name. It pulls directly from google+ because they really
want to cram that crappy social media platform down peoples throat. It works with an invite
system that is based on your google+ friends and circles. So as of right now I am not making
the activity because it seems redundent but if you have a better idea then I'll listen.


Sounds awesome! I guess I just need to know how the invited players google+ records can be found
so that I can pull that information in the MapActivity and KillActivity. I'm glad that it's not
going to be too much work!  -Katherine
