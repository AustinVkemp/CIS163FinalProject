I was looking on the google play services page and it looks like we wont really need the
add info activity for a picture and name. It pulls directly from google+ because they really
want to cram that crappy social media platform down peoples throat. It works with an invite
system that is based on your google+ friends and circles. So as of right now I am not making
the activity because it seems redundent but if you have a better idea then I'll listen.
